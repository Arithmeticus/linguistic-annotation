> Deliverables of W3C’s [Web Annotation Working Group](http://www.w3.org/annotation). Note that **_the Working Group is now Closed;_** for further discussions on the evolution of Web Annotation technologies at W3C, possible errata, etc, please join the [W3C Open Annotation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/). In particular, if you want to submit an erratum, the best is to follow the procedure described on the [errata page](https://www.w3.org/annotation/errata/) of the documents.

We include the current HTML specifications of Web Annotation in the repo. It is yet to be confirmed as to whether the [W3C Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/doc-license) permits to create a Markdown edition of the Web Annotation standards to develop Web-Annotation-based specifications for linguistic annotation on that basis:
